every device needs the following:
IP address
subnet mask 
broadcast address

# network classes         - look at the first octet

class                   network                     hosts allowed

A                       1.0 -> 127.0                16,777,216
                        ex: 17.24.88.9

# subnet masks

                        last 3 octets are for hosts

                        last octet is for hosts

you can subnet them however you like

####################################### DNS ###########################################
ip address              - shows ip address info
ip addr
ip a
ip address show 

# the lo device is the loopback device virtual device used to comminicate to itself (localhost)

ifconfig  

# hostname              - human readable name for an IP address 

DNS translates hostnames/domain names to ip and vice versa
FQDN                    - fully qualified domain name 
TLD                     - top level domain (.com .net .org etc)
Domain                  - just to the left of the domain
subdomain               - left of the domain 

hostname                - command displays the currnet hostname
uname - n               - same

hostname -f             - fully qualified host name 

hostname <name>         - temp change hostname til next reboot

# to permanently change the hostname edit the /etc/hostname file 

# to lookup DNS 
host                                - look up a 
host <dns name or IP address> 

dig 

# etc/hosts
is local to your linux system it doesnt propagate to the rest of the network 

sample hosts file 

127.0.0.1   localhost
1.2.1.6     webprod01.mycompany.com
10.11.12.14 webprod02.mycompany.com

etc/hosts is checked before DNS servers


# etc/nsswitch.conf
NSS                                 - name service switch 
NSS file controls the order that ips and hostnames are searched 

ex. 
hosts: files dns
hostsL files nis dns

once something is found hte search stops
